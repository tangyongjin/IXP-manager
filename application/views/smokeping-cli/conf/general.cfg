    Smokeping Configuration Templates

    Please see: https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/wiki/Smokeping

    You should not need to edit these files - instead use your own custom skins. If
    you can't effect the changes you need with skinning, consider posting to the mailing
    list to see if it can be achieved / incorporated.
